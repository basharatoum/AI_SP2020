The evalFunc in the MaxConnect4Game.py file counts the threats and the score difference at the current
state of the game. The current state will be whatever state the board is in 
at depth i> depth limit. 

A threat is whenever there is three pieces of the same type and an empty slot in a diagonal, column or row.
A threat is also something that could happen in the next move. So if there is a three greens at the top and to get
to the empty spot between them it will take more than one piece, then this is not a threat.

The eval function also takes into consideration the current score the game is in.
